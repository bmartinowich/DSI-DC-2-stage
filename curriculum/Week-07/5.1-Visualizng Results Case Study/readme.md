<a name="opening"></a>
## Opening (# mins)
- Review prior labs/homework, upcoming projects, or exit tickets, when applicable
- Review lesson objectives
- Discuss real world relevance of these topics
- Relate topics to the [Data Science Workflow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx2SHQGVqWasOGY4dE95OFVvZjQ/view?usp=sharing) - i.e. are these concepts typically used to acquire, parse, clean, mine, refine, model, present, or deploy?

**Check:** Ask students to define, explain, or recall any relevant prework concepts.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction: Topic (# mins)

Write in a student-facing voice. Introduce the concept in short sentences or bullets. Provide context and _italicize_ any new concepts or vocab terms.


> Instructor Note: Use these to write notes specifically for instructors.

#### Subheadings

Use them to divide content.


**Check:** Include 1-2 Knowledge Checks per section

<a name="demo"></a>
## Demo: Topic (# mins)

Walk through a demonstration of the code or some related concept together as a class.

```python
code
```


**Check:** What was that code all about? Etc.

<a name="guided-practice"></a>
## Guided Practice: Topic (# mins)
Solve a problem or apply this topic to a real world scenario. Should require the use of current topics. Can be done individually, in pairs, or groups.

Provide **starter code** in a Jupyter notebook or other script to help students begin this exercise. When doing so, also provide **solution code** with the answers for instructors to check student work.

> Note: Link to the solution code in a note for instructors.

**Check:** Here is where you should ask students for answers or explanations. Instructors will use solution code to check this.

<a name="ind-practice"></a>
## Independent Practice: Topic (# minutes)

Ask students to create a deliverable that meets certain criteria. Like before, provide any starter code to help students begin the assignment, and solution code for instructors to check their work.

Starter code can be in one file with different headers for guided or independent practice. Solution code should be in a separate file than the starter code (obviously), and can simply follow the same format.

> Note: Link to the solution code in a note for instructors.

**Check:** Were students able to create the desired deliverable(s)? Did it meet requirements / constraints?


<a name="conclusion"></a>
## Conclusion (# mins)
- Review any independent practice deliverable(s)

- Recap topic(s) covered in short takeaway bullet points

- Describe homework or any upcoming tasks
