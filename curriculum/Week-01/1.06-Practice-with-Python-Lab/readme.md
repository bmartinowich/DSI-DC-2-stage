##Practice With Python in Project Euler

- What to do: 
  - Go to [Project Euler](projecteuler.net)
  - Sign in
  - In the archives, complete as many Problems as possible

- Workflow: 
  - Groups of 3
  - May work together on each problem or divide and conquer, but stay in the same place to help each other when you get stuck and share solutions as you go!
  - Each problem solution in its own .py file (written in atom or other text editor)
  - Submitted in a single group repository
    - someone in the team should create a new repository (not in this repo!) and share it with the group
    - all members (including creator) branch it (because we're working closely together)
    - all members clone it to their local computer
    - commit each solution to your own branch
    - merge branches when ready to submit
    - submit a link to the repository (make sure to make it public) on garnet

- Due: August 02, 2016 (today) at 1PM
