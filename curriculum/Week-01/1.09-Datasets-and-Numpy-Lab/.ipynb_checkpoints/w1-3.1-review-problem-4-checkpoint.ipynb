    "### Review problem 4\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem you will write a function that calculates summary statistics for distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept two arguments: first the ```i``` variable generated by the outside for loop and second the ```numbers``` list that contains the set of numbers.\n",
    "- Print a string indicating what ```i``` currently is, like so:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    i is currently: 1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Calculate, without using numpy, the **mean**.\n",
    "- Calculate the **median** of ```numbers``` using ```np.median()```.\n",
    "- Print the mean and median like so:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    mean: 12\n",
    "    median: 9\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Notes/Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you forgot how to calculate by hand any of the summary statistics, look it up!\n",
    "- You should define your function **outside** of the provided for loop, and then call it with ```i``` and ```numbers``` within the for loop\n",
    "- For the curious about the for loop:\n",
    "    - ```for i in range(1, 15, 2)``` assigns ```i``` from 1 to 15 with a step size of 2\n",
    "    - ```numbers``` is created with a **list comprehension**, which is an alternative to looping and creates a new list from elements of another list. We will go over these in more detail later.\n",
    "    - ```np.random.randn()``` generates a uniform random number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - ```np.random.gamma(i, i, 100)``` generates 100 samples from a gamma distribution with mean ```i``` and standard deviation ```i```. **Dont worry about this now** (but feel free to look it up if youre curious)!\n",
