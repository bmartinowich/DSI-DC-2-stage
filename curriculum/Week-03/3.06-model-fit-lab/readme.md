## Introduction

In this lab we'll learn about a new measure of model fit called the coefficient of determination or _r-squared_.

#### Requirements

- Make several models and compute the goodness of fit values
- Learn how to interpret r-squared
- Explore the effect of outliers on model fit

**Bonus:**
- Explore the relationship between model complexity and goodness of fit
- Read through the case study on confounding

#### Starter code

Take a look at the [starter code](https://github.com/ga-students/DSI-DC-2/blob/master/curriculum/Week-03/3.06-model-fit-lab/starter-code.ipynb) as soon as you are ready.

#### Deliverable

* A completed Jupyter notebook
