## Introduction

In this lab we'll begin cleaning, transforming, and modeling a dataset on airport cancellations. Recall your lessons on pandas from last week and utilize these skills throughout. The dataset displays delay metrics for all major US airports between 2004-2012.

Before you start, think about the scenarios and form a preliminary plan to work with the data and produce analytic conclusions for the relevant stakeholders. Try to anticipate what questions the stakeholders will ask and be prepared to answer.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Practice datatype conversion
- Practice categorical data techniques
- Transform data into usable quantities

You'll also want to do: 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Generate correlation matrix of the features
- Generate linear regression models
- Optimize your model


#### Starter code

Grab the starter code [here](/starter.ipynb)


#### Deliverable

You should have a completed model
