## Introduction

In this lab we'll begin cleaning, transforming, and modeling a dataset on airport cancellations. Recall your lessons on pandas from last week and utilize these skills throughout. 

You've been hired by the FAA as a consultant to analyze the operations of major airports around the country. The FAA wants to cut down on delays nationwide, and the most important part of this task is understanding the characteristics and groupings of airports based on a dataset of departure and operational delays.

A certain degree of delay is expected in airport operations, however the FAA is noticing significant delays with certain airports
When a flight takes off, it's departure delay is recorded in minutes, as well as operational data relating to this delay
At the end of the year, this data is averaged out for each airport. Your datasets have these averaged for a 10 year range between 2004 and 2014.

Over this 10 year range, some delay times have not improved or have worsened.

Point: Your task is to understand the distribution, characteristics, and components of individual airports operations that are leading to these delays.

Before you start, think about the scenarios and form a preliminary plan to work with the data and produce analytic conclusions for the relevant stakeholders. Try to anticipate what questions the stakeholders will ask and be prepared to answer.

## Exercise.

You will help the FAA:

- Organize and store their data so that they can easily understand it after your consulting work is done
- Mine and refine the data to uncover its basic attributes and characteristics
- Conduct regression analysis using a linear model of your choice
- Optimize the linear model

When you've finished your analysis, the FAA would like a report detailing your findings, with recommendations as to which airports and operational characteristics they should target to decrease delays.

Here are some questions to keep in mind:

- What operational factors are most directly correlated to delays?
- Take a look at airports groupings - are there any relationships by region? Size?

For more instructions, follow the questions included in the starter code.


#### Requirements

- Practice datatype conversion
- Practice categorical data techniques
- Transform data into usable quantities

You'll also want to do: 
- Exploratory data analysis
- Generate correlation matrix of the features
- Generate linear regression models
- Optimize your model


#### Starter code

Grab the starter code from the "code" folder.


#### Deliverable

You should have a completed model
