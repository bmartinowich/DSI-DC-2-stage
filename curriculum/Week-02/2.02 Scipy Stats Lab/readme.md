## Overview!

Today's lessons were a deep dive into the world of statistics. While these concepts are potentially challenging intially, they underpin the fundamentals of the rest of our curriculum.

You should hold yourself accountable for revisiting the notebooks presented in today's class. Between three independent code-alongs demonstrating these concepts, continued reinforcement is available.

The goal of this lab is to reinforce today's concepts through continued self-exploration of Python's statistical computing libraries. The emphasis is on grasping the implications of descriptive statistics.
