# Office Hours

Office hours are generally from 5 to 6:30pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, always held in the student work area on the 8th floor. Two instructors will be present. They're completely optional, but can be extremely useful!

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question. If everyone's having the same problem, the instructors may conduct an informal mini-lesson.
